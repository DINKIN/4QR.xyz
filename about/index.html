    <h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
    <h4>Q: What is the purpose of this site?</h4>
    <p>
        A: 4QR.xyz was originally created by <a href="http://www.areben.com/">Alexander Reben</a> to encode digital artworks into QR codes.
        <br> QR codes with an embedded URL will directly open in a browser when read.
        <br> So a website was created to render the data contained in a URL into a browser.
        <br> This allows all the data needed to make a webpage to be rendered without that webpage hosted on a server.
        <br> It became apparent that the tool itself could be used to create and share small creative web applications
        <br>(as well as any other code that a browser can display) is a non centralized way.
        <br>The data can be stored in QR codes, link shorteners, NFC cards or the blockchain.
    </p>
    <h4>Q: Why does this site look like it is from 1997?</h4>
    <p>
        A: Everything in the site is trimmed down and optimized for bandwidth (at least that's the excuse).
    </p>
    <h4>Q: Can I find out more about the code in this site?</h4>
    <p>
        A: Check out the <a href="http://refrence.4QR.xyz/">refrence page</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/artBoffin/4QR.xyz">GitHub page</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Q: Does my code run on your server?</h4>
    <p>
        A: No, all code is run locally in the browser of the person who clicked the link.
    </p>
    <h4>Q: Can you take down a link?</h4>
    <p>
        A: No, since there is no storage of the link, it only exists where it is shared.
